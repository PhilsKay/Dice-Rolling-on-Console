# Dice-Rolling-on-Console
is a Dice rolling game whereby you roll your dice and you get your answer.
Actually did this simple program to know how the language works.
The AI generates a random decimal number from 0 to 1.
Then the user is asked to input a number of its choice from 1 to 6,  after choosing then the 
AI's random number is multiplied by your own choice of number and a result is made
Which is the dice number.It may be from 0 to 6.
And I handled every possible exception.You may try yours it a good practice.
I made this with no research.
